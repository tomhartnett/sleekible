## SearchMoji - Privacy Policy

### Our Commitment to Privacy

Your privacy is important to us. To protect that privacy, we provide this notice to explain our information collection practices.

### No Information Collected

The SearchMoji app does not collect any user information. There is no sign-up, login, or opportunity in the app to give us your personal information. The app's \"Favorites\" feature allows the user to save favorite Emojis and \"Emoji phrases\", but this information is stored locally on the device.

### In-App Feedback

The app does provide a feedback feature to allow you to provide us feedback on the app. This feature opens a simple email to us. Be aware that by sending the email, you are giving us your email address. We do not use this email address for anything other than responding to your feedback, via email.

### No External Services

The app does not use any third party / external services or code. There are no ads, analytics, etc. All source code used to create the app is written and maintained by the developer, Sleekible LLC.

### How to Contact Us

Should you have questions or concerns about this privacy policy, please email [searchmoji@sleekible.com](mailto:searchmoji@sleekible.com).
