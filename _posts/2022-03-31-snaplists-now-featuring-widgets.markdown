The latest version of Snaplists, 2022.2, now available in the App Store, adds widgets to the app.

There are multiple sizes and types of widgets supported:
- A **Specific List** widget that shows a single list on your home screen.
- A **Lists** widget that shows all of your lists, sorted by most recently updated.
- Small, medium, and large variations of the above widget types.

It's never too late to adopt a feature introduced in the previous version of iOS two years ago ðŸ™ƒ
